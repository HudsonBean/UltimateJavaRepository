# Unit 4 - Iteration

## 4.1 - `while` Loops

Nothing new here. While loops perform pretty much the same in all languages, while a condition is true excecute this code.

## 4.2 - `for` Loops

Nothing new here for `for` loops. I did learn about the equivialnt of Python's `in` operator in Java is the `colon` this will be useful so I don't have to make `for i` loops in BPA and I can just loop through arrays or maps with ease ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤™
