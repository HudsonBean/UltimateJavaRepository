# 2.8 Wrapper Classes - Integer and Double

Just goes more into those class type variables I talked about earlier in unit 1. Something to note is the program suggests using:

```
double a = new Double(5.0);
```

however, it is interesting to note not only is this depracated it is also non-functional it would be functional if the `d` on data type `double` was capatalized. The more-effective way to create this class-type double would be to:

```
Double a = 5.0;
```

this ensures a more powerful double variable with the methods attached, etc.

Vice versa for Integer class-types as well.
