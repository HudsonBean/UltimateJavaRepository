# Unit 05 - Writing Classes

Nothing new here
I did learn at BPA that you can have classes inside of classes though for exmaple:

```java
public class Topic5_1AnatomyOfClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
    static class hello {

    }
}
```

Which can be useful if I need to make a quick data structure for something that I don't need all the time in every class.

## 5.1 - Anatomy of a Class

Nothing new here either just learned that I should use privates for all my variables and use getters/setters if I need to change them.

## 5.2 - Constructors

Nothing new here either I did want to ask Mr.S if anything like `__init__` exists in Java as it does in Python.

## 5.3 - Documentation with Comments

Did poorly on this quiz but it was because I struggle with following the logic of coded questions sometimes and I forgot the `-1` on the .length. But I understand having comments for docs and I use vs code snippets to generate my code docs for me in other languages.
