# Unit 10 - Recursion

## 10.1 - Recursion

Recursion is very similiar to loops but it helps break larger iterative problems into smaller repetetive tasks and it has some niceness to it. I doubt we will be learning all about it and it's use cases such as how to navigate trees with it, etc. Some languages dont support recursion at all so that's interesting.
