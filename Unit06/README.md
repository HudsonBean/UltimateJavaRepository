# Unit 6 - Array

Nothing new here I know how to create arrays and empty arrays
Predefined:

```java
int[] arr = {1,12,15};
// {1,12,15}
```

Size but no values yet

```java
int[] arr = new int[5];
// {0,0,0,0,0,0}
```

Remember first index is 0 so there is 6 valuse on that last one because the first value has an index of 0.

## 6.1 - Array Creation and Access

Nothing new here I explained before how to create them. To access arrays just use their index

```java
int[] arr = {1,2,3,4,5};
arr[0] // 1
arr[2] // 3
```

## 6.2 - Traversing Arrays

Nothing new here either we breifly discussed transversing 2 dimensional arrays (hash maps/dictionaries) earlier in the year and if it was possible in Java.

## 6.3 - Enhanced for Loop for Arrays

Nothing new here I am excited to get into arrays with Objects and hastables with objects it'd be cool to do something like:

```java
for (Student object : students) {
    print(object.getAge());
}
```

## 6.4 - Developing Algorithms Using Arrays

Nothing new here just combining the knowledge of arrays and algorithims.
