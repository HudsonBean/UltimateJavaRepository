# 3.3 - `if-else` Statements

Nothing knew here.
I did score poorly on the assignments only because they were super hard to follow logic based in my opinion but maybe I was just out of it. The biggest thing that they seem to be stressing is the order of opperations multiple if statemnts follow compared to an else statmenet for example:

```
// #1
if (true) {
    // Do something
} else {
    // Do something else
}

// #2
if (true) {
    // Do something
}
if (true) {
    //Do something
}
```

in this example #1 will only run one based on the conditional while in the second it will run both and has a chance to excecute both, one, or neither based on the conditional.
