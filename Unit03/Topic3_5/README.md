# 3.5 - Compound Boolean Expressions

Nothing new here. Just had a quick discussion to know that if you compare string objects with `==` it compares object memory locations not content. You must use `String.equals(String2)` for that.

Also learned about `&&` and `||` precedence with boolean values. `&&` means false will win and `||` means true will win given in statements such as these: `false && true` and `false || true`.
