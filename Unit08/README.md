# Unit 8 - 2D Array

## 8.1 - 2D Array

Nothing crazy here already pretty known stuff. Same stuff as when we did ArrayLists with objects or array lists inside those. Except these are primitive meaning there is no methods/properties to them outside the default ones. Length with only tell you the length of rows there is not columns!

## 8.2 - Transversing 2D Arrays

Also nothing new here I learned about these a lot more when I was doing complexity times as a for loop inside a for loop has a `O(n^2)` complexity time.
