# 1.2 Variables and Data Types

Variables and data types vary in lots of languages but most have the base idea of initializing a variable: `int a` and declaring a variable `a = 5`.

# Primitive vs. Reference types

In Java there exist two main data types. The more specific and limited one being primitive types.
These are such as `int`, `char`, etc. They are just the base data types and are good for allocating very small memory to a piece of data. On the other hand reference types are more broad and general and they are class objects, enums, etc. But for this case of doing variables they are `Integer`, `Double`, etc. this allows your variables to have methods and more functionality; however, it comes at the cost of memory.
