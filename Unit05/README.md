# Unit 05 - Writing Classes

Nothing new here
I did learn at BPA that you can have classes inside of classes though for exmaple:

```java
public class Topic5_1AnatomyOfClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
    static class hello {

    }
}
```

Which can be useful if I need to make a quick data structure for something that I don't need all the time in every class.

## 5.1 - Anatomy of a Class

Nothing new here either just learned that I should use privates for all my variables and use getters/setters if I need to change them.

## 5.2 - Constructors

Nothing new here either I did want to ask Mr.S if anything like `__init__` exists in Java as it does in Python.

## 5.3 - Documentation with Comments

Did poorly on this quiz but it was because I struggle with following the logic of coded questions sometimes and I forgot the `-1` on the .length. But I understand having comments for docs and I use vs code snippets to generate my code docs for me in other languages.

## 5.4 - Accessor Methods

Nothing new here I already know how to define methods in a class and how to make getters and setters within Java.

## 5.5 - Mutator Methods

Same thing here nothing new I know about setters and how to affect private variables with them üëç

```java
public class Test {
    private int num;
    public Test(int n) {
        num = n;
    }
    public int getter() {
        return num;
    }
    public void setter(int n) {
        num = n;
    }
}
```

## 5.6 - Writing Methods

## 5.7 - Static Variables and Methods

## 5.8 - Scope and Access

## 5.9 - `this` Keyword

## 5.10 - Ethical and Social Implications of Computing Systems
